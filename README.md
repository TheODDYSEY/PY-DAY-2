**PLP PYTHON DAY 1: List Operations**  
This Python script demonstrates various list operations, including appending elements, inserting values at specific positions, extending a list, removing elements, sorting, and finding an index of a specific value.  

### **Operations Performed**  
- **Creating a List**: Initializes an empty list.  
- **Appending Elements**: Adds elements `10, 20, 30, 40` to the list.  
- **Inserting an Element**: Inserts `15` at the second position.  
- **Extending the List**: Adds `[50, 60, 70]` to the list.  
- **Removing an Element**: Removes the last element.  
- **Sorting**: Sorts the list in ascending order.  
- **Finding an Index**: Prints the index of `30` in the list.  

### **How to Use**  
1. Run the script in a Python environment.  
2. The list will be modified step by step based on the operations performed.  
3. The index of `30` will be printed as the output.  

### **Example Output**  
```
Index of 30: 3
```

### **Notes**  
- Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.  
- Modify the list elements to experiment with different values.
